## Description

Repository containers Singularity container defintion files and necessary commands to
build those containers.

Ideally, you'd want to keep these definition files updated so that lab members can
re-build containers as needed.

## Locate Singularity images

Pre-built Singularity images are located at `/lab/data/sw/containers/`.

Thanks to Peter Orchard (@porchard).
